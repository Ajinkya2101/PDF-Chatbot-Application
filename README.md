# PDF-Chatbot-Application
Welcome to the PDF Chatbot Application! This application allows users to upload and interact with multiple PDF documents using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Built using Streamlit and Python, the app leverages vectorization and LangChain for an enhanced NLP experience.

Features
Upload Multiple PDFs: Users can upload multiple PDF files to the application.
Natural Language Interaction: Communicate with the uploaded PDFs using natural language queries.
Vectorization: Efficient document processing using vectorization techniques.
LangChain Integration: Utilize LangChain for advanced NLP capabilities.

Installation:
To run this application locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install the required dependencies

Usage:
1. Start the Streamlit application "streamlit run app.py"
2. Upload PDFs
3. Ask Questions

How It Works
PDF Upload: Users can upload multiple PDF documents through the Streamlit interface.
Vectorization: The uploaded PDFs are processed and converted into vector representations using vectorization techniques.
NLP Processing: Queries are handled using LangChain, which processes the natural language input and retrieves relevant information from the vectorized PDFs.
Response Generation: The application generates and displays answers to the user's queries based on the processed PDF content.
